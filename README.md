## A large scale streaming and data processing architecture ##
This project focuses on the design and development of a data processing architecture for high density data streams. Many methods of data processing can use advanced Machine Learning algorithms or statistical methods, but cannot handle large amounts of data, or data which arrives at a very high frequency. The resulting architecture will focus on extracting knowledge from high frequency data, such as outlier detection or classification methods. As a result, the Data Analysis Engine could send notifications if parts of the data are missing, incorrect or exceed certain thresholds. The architecture will be based on Spark and Spark Streaming for data processing, with connectors developed to receive different streams of data.
